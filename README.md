# Throwaway Shadows Using Parallel Encoders Generative Adversarial Network

## Contributions

 *(i) A novel GAN-based image inpainting approach to remove the shadows of objects from facial images.*

 *(ii) Generates a well-incorporated semantic structure and disentangles the visual discrepancies issue under the shadow region by employing a combined parallel operation of standard and partial convolution in a single generator model.*

 *(iii) To train in a supervised manner, we create a paired synthetic shadow dataset using facial images from the CelebA dataset.*

 *(iv) Removes the shadow and creates perceptually better outputs with fine details in challenging facial images.*
